Requirements Document <br /> <br />
Application title: Triathlon Registration App <br />
Purpose: A triathlon registration app allows an athlete to register for one of three national triathlons to qualify for the Ironman World Championship. <br />
Algorithms: <br />
1. The triathlon registration app has two Text Fields: One requests the number of athletes on the userâ€™s team ($725), and the other requests the location. A Spinner control allows the athlete to select one of the three possible locations: Lake Placid, Big Island Hawaii, and Miami. The app also displays a title, an image, and a Button control. <br />
2. After the user taps or clicks the Button control, the selected location and the total team cost are displayed in a TextView control.
